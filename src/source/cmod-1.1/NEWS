News in release 1.1 (release date: 1998-09-26)

* Documentation added.  The Texinfo manual should now be fairly complete.

* New command:

	module try-add

* New documented preprocessor, with the following new features:

  - Shell escapes using the "$(...)" notation.
  - Variable substitution can now handle several modifiers such as 
    "${FOO:-bar}".
  - Unset variables are handled in a sane and documented way.
  - Variable expansion is now done early, so variables can be used
    anywhere.  Even commands, such as "prepend-path", can be the
    result of variable expansion.

* New documented tokenizer.

* Improved and documented error handling.  The error handling is now
  designed, not ad-hoc.

* Cmod now comes with a tiny string library that is used throughout
  the code instead of using char-pointers.  This results in cleaner
  code, and hopefully fewer bugs.

* Several bugs fixed.



News in release 1.0 (release date: 1998-02-16)

* Portability vastly increased.  See README for a list of hosts where
  cmod has been successfully compiled.  You can now compile cmod with
  a pre-ansi-C compiler.  GNU make is no longer required.

* By default, cmod now installs itself under /usr/local.  The module
  files are located in /usr/local/etc/cmod/modulefiles.

* You can now type "make install-sample" to help you set up your
  module files for the first time.  You still need to manually define
  the "default" module, and you probably want to manually edit the
  module files that "make install-sample" creates.

* New commands:

	module avail
	module rm	    (synonym for "module unload")
	module --version
	

* If there is a directory X11 on $MODULEPATH, "module add X11"
  will now attempt to load X11/default.  If X11/default is a symbolic
  link "module avail" will indicate which module it actually refers
  to.

* Improved and documented initialization files.

* Several bugs fixed.



News in release 0.9 (release date: 1997-12-07)

* Everything.  This is the first public release.
