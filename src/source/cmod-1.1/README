Introduction to cmod
====================

This is cmod, which provides modularized initialization of environment
variables such as PATH.  Once cmod is installed and configured typing
"module add tex" might add /sw/tex/teTeX/bin/sparc-solaris2.5.1 to
PATH, /sw/tex/teTeX/man to MANPATH, etc.  Cmod provides a way for the
system administrator to define module files (such as "tex") that
modify the environment in well-defined ways.  It allows the user to
select the modules that should be active; the user can also override
the modules provided by the administrator.

Cmod is released under the GNU General Public License; see COPYING for
the details of that license.



Distribution overview
=====================

Some noteworthy files in this distribution are:

  INSTALL    	Generic installation instructions.  See also below.
  cmod.info	Documentation in info format.
  cmod.texi	The source for cmod.info; if you have TeX you can
		"make cmod.ps" to get a printable file.
  NEWS		What is new in this release?
  AUTHORS    	Contact and copyright information.
  COPYING	License information.
  README.DEVO   What to do if you typed "make maintainer-clean" (or if
		you got cmod from the CVS repository of Lysator).
  RELEASING	How to make a release (checklist for the maintainer).



Basic installation instructions
===============================

To compile, test and install cmod, type this:

	./configure	# See INSTALL for the available options.
	make
	make check	# This step is optional, but recommended.
	make install

You should see the string "All tests passed" when "make check"
exists.  If not, check MACHINES to see if there is a known problem
with your machine.  If any test fails for a reason not mentioned in
MACHINES it is a bug; please report it.

Your cmod installation is useless until you have created module files.
You can use "make install-sample" to install a few sample module files
in ${prefix}/cmod/modulefiles.  They are primarily useful as examples
of how module files can look.  Don't use this target if already have
created some module files; it will overwrite files without asking for
confirmation.

Cmod will create the following directory structure when you type "make
install":

	${prefix} # defaults to /usr/local, can be changed with --prefix
	${prefix}/libexec # Contains the cmod binary.
	${prefix}/etc/cmod # Contains init scripts for various shells.
	${prefix}/etc/cmod/modulefiles # Default location for module files.

See INSTALL for more information about the installation process.



Getting cmod
============

The cmod home page is located at

	http://www.lysator.liu.se/cmod/

You can also retrieve cmod via ftp from

	ftp://ftp.lysator.liu.se/pub/unix/cmod/



Cmod is portable software
=========================

cmod has been tested on the systems below.  It should work on many
more.  Only the most recent version of cmod that succeeded to compile
on a given host is included in the data below.

In short, cmod runs with the native "cc" compiler on at least these
operating systems:

	Digital Unix 4.0B
	Dynix 3.1.1
	FreeBSD 2.1.5
	HP-UX 9.03, 10.20
	Irix 4.0.5, 5.3, 6.2
	Linux 2.0, Red Hat 4.2, 5.0
	PowerMaxOS 4.1
	SunOS 4.1.1_U1, 4.1.3_U1, 4.1.4
	SysVr4
	Ultrix 4.5
	Unix 3.0

In addition to the above, cmod runs on these operating systems once
you install gcc on them (they don't come with a C compiler included):
	
	AIX 4.2
	Solaris 2.4, 2.5.1, 2.6, 2.7

It also runs when compiled with these compilers:

	SparcWorks 5.1 (both c89 and cc)
	egcs 1.0.2
	gcc 2.6.2, 2.6.3, 2.7.2, 2.7.2.1, 2.7.2.2, 2.7.2.3, 2.8.0, 2.8.1

[1]  Two tests fails.  See MACHINES.


The easiest way to make sure that a certain compiler, operating
system, or computer brand is included on this list in the future is to
donate the required equipment and software to Lysator.  We cannot
promise that we will be able to port cmod to everything, but we will
make a try.



Versions 1.0.post.8 -- 1.0.post.10
----------------------------------

Very small changes were made to the C code between 1.0.post.8 and 1.1,
so cmod 1.1 should still compile on these systems.

IRIX 6.2, cc, unknown
IRIX 6.2, gcc 2.7.2.3, unknown
PowerMaxOS 4.1, cc, Concurrent Hawk (PowerPC)
SunOS 4.1.3_U1, gcc 2.6.0, sun4m
SysVr4, gcc 2.7.2.3, Motorola (m88k)
Unix 3.0, cc, encore (m88k)



Version 0.9.post.11
-------------------

This machine is currently down due to hardware problems, so cmod
cannot be tested on it.

SunOS 4.1.1_U1, gcc 2.7.2.3, Sun 3/480 (estragon.lysator.liu.se)
SunOS 4.1.1_U1, cc, Sun 3/480 (estragon.lysator.liu.se)



Version 0.9
-----------

These machines no longer exists, so newer releases of cmod cannot be
tested on them.

IRIX 4.0.5, gcc 2.7.2.2, SGI IRIS 4D20 (viggen.lysator.liu.se)
Ultrix 4.5, gcc 2.7.2.2, VAX 6520 (prostetnic.lysator.liu.se) [1]

[1]: some test cases fail since /bin/sh lacks the "echo" and "unset"
     commands.  The 1.1 testsuite no longer relies on them.
