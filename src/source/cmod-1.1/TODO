High priority (things that stops a release)
===========================================

(Nothing is left on this list.)



Medium priority (things that really would be nice)
==================================================

* Write a test program that checks that memmove handles overlapping
  regions of memory correctly.

* env_environ() should return an enum instead of a magic number.

* parse_module() should make a copy of the environment before it
  alters it.  That way, a perfect undo could be made if the module has
  to be aborted.  The way things are done now unfortunate side effects
  sometimes occur (for instance if you use setenv on a variable that
  already had a value).

* "module avail" should detect the actual screen width instead of
  using a fixed constant (which is currently 80).



Low priority (worthwhile things that I don't consider very important)
=====================================================================

* Jens Larsson thinks that the commands initadd and initdel should be
  added.

* Path optimizer: Follow symbolic links to get a faster shell.  If
  /foo/bin and /bar/bin ultimately points to the same directory after
  symlinc expansion there is no need to include them both in the
  optimized path.

* Path optimizer: remove non-existing directories.

* "module show foo".

* "module help foo".

* Consider adding options to "module avail" analogous to the GNU ls
  options -1, -w COLS and --width=COLS.



Dubious (things that maybe shouldn't be implemented at all)
===========================================================

* We maybe need a new parser that understands options.  Once we have
  that we may replace "module try-add xyzzy" with "module add
  --ignore-missing xyzzy".  On the other hand, this may be a bad
  idea.  Think more about this.
